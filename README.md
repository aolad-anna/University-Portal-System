# PROBLEM DOMAIN

## Background to the Problem

Different educational institutions are seen to have their own portal services to manage their academic work with the students. These applications are mostly seen in the private universities in Bangladesh. Now, the project team is planning to apply the same thing and conception in the schools and colleges and see whether it satisfies the need of the students and the teachers. The System needs to be designed in such a way that it may ensure the communications and necessary class works among them. Also, the users would be able to do their academic work at ease. Often it is seen that the students miss the class due to some circumstances and the teachers sometimes fail to communicate with the students under them if there is no class representative in the class. So, the academic work gets hampered. There should be a system where the assigned people can access and get benefitted with their academic work. So, if such system is provided in a class of not more than 50 students and the teachers who are assigned for different subjects, then both the students and the teachers can get up to date with all the works regarding the subjective studies and any student won&#39;t lag behind.


## Solution to the Problem

Nowadays, the people are more affectionate towards technology. Almost everything is based on technology. The purpose of study should not be neglected if technology is at the user&#39;s hand. So, a web application may be developed to full fill the need of the students and the teachers of a college and see whether it makes a useful impact or not. The webpage will enable the teachers to upload notes and important notices to the students. The students may not be lagged behind in case of unwanted absence. Some more features can be added to benefit of the students and teachers. The colleges and deal with an IT farm to make them such software to solve their need. The farms can make a software similar to the plan which is documented in this project.

The main focus of this project is to satisfy the demand of the students and teachers regarding study and communication purpose. The system may ensure various use of different features including notes uploading, online quiz, direct messaging among the teachers and the students and among the students as well. Final result uploading and auto grade calculations after necessary input. The system is planned for having to different users of two different interfaces; as the user type &quot;teacher&quot; and user type &quot;student&quot;. Also, the teachers will not have to use an excel sheet rather the system may provide the name slot of the students for attendance in the interface of the user teacher. So, the objective is to ease the job of the teachers and helping the students to cope up.

The developing farm and the college authority may look for further improvement and extensions of such system. There should be good amount of research to understand the need of the students and read their mentality of what they want to have for their academic excellence. The requirements of this sort of systems should be dynamic and according to the feedback of the user.
